  abstract = {Consider repeated measures data with many zeros. For the case with one grouping factor and one repeated measure, we examine several models, assuming that the nonzero data are roughly lognormal. One of the simplest approaches is to model the zeros as left-censored observations from the lognormal distribution. A random effectis assumed for subjects. The censored model makes a strong assumption about the relationship between the zeros and the nonzero values. To check on this, you can instead assume that some of the zeros are ?true? zeros and model them as Bernoulli. Then the other values are modeled with a censored lognormal. A logistic model is used for the Bernoulli p, the probability of a true nonzero. The fit of the pure left-censored lognormal can be assessed by testing the hypothesis that p is 1, as described by Moulton and Halsey.1 The model can also be simplified by omitting the censoring, leaving a logistic model for the zeros and a lognormal model for the nonzero values. This is approximately equivalent to modeling the zero and nonzero values separately, a two-part model. In contrast to the censored model, this model assumes only a slight relationship (a covariance component) between the occurrence of zeros and the size of the nonzero values. The models are compared in terms of an example with data from children?s private speech.},

  abstract        = {Continuous (clustered) proportion data often arise in various domains of medicine and public health where the response variable of interest is a proportion (or percentage) quantifying disease status for the cluster units, ranging between zero and one. However, because of the presence of relatively disease-free as well as heavily diseased subjects in any study, the proportion values can lie in the interval [0,1]. While beta regression can be adapted to assess covariate effects in these situations, its versatility is often challenged because of the presence/excess of zeros and ones because the beta support lies in the interval (0,1). To circumvent this, we augment the probabilities of zero and one with the beta density, controlling for the clustering effect. Our approach is Bayesian with the ability to borrow information across various stages of the complex model hierarchy and produces a computationally convenient framework amenable to available freeware. The marginal likelihood is tractable and can be used to develop Bayesian case-deletion influence diagnostics based on q-divergence measures. Both simulation studies and application to a real dataset from a clinical periodontology study quantify the gain in model fit and parameter estimation over other ad hoc alternatives and provide quantitative insight into assessing the true covariate effects on the proportion responses.},

  abstract = {[Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(λ) random variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(λ) distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state and the mean number of defects λ in the imperfect state may depend on covariates. Sometimes p and λ are unrelated; other times p is a simple function of λ such as p=1/(1+λ <sup>τ</sup>) for an unknown constant τ. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's. Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but also why the means are lower.]},

  abstract = {The purpose of this work is to present suitable statistical methods to study the performance of undergraduate students based on the incidence/proportion of failed courses/subjects.
 Three approaches are considered: first, the proportion of failed subjects is modeled considering a zero-one augmented beta distribution; second, discrete models are used to model the probability of failing subjects with logit link; third, incidence is modeled using regression for count data with log link and the logarithm of the total number of subjects as an offset.
 Zero-inflated versions are used to account for the excess of zeros in the data when appropriate and we also considered the heterogeneous dispersion parameter, when applicable.
 Overall, the zero-inflated negative binomial and zero inflated beta-binomial models, with regression on the mean and the dispersion parameters, present good measures of goodness of fit to the data. The database consists of records of Engineering major students who entered the State University of Campinas, Brazil, from 2000 to 2005. Entrance exam scores and demographic variables as well as socio-economic status are considered as covariates in the models.},

Such characteristics prevent the analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-test and other frequently used standard tests from providing the correct inferences when the comparison of means is of interest. One solution to the problem is to introduce a parametric structure based on log-normal distributions with zero values and then construct a likelihood ratio test. While such a likelihood ratio test possesses excellent type I error control and power, its implementation requires a rather complicated iterative optimization program. In this paper, we propose a Wald test with simple computation. We then conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to compare the type I error rates and powers of the proposed Wald test with those of the likelihood ratio test. Our simulation study indicates that although the likelihood ratio test slightly outperforms the Wald test, the performance of the Wald test is also satisfactory, especially when the sample sizes are reasonably large. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed Wald test by analysing a clinical study assessing the effects of a computerized prospective drug utilization intervention on in-patient charges.},

  abstract      = {Consider two-parameter statistical models for positive continuous observations. Suppose that these models are closed under change of scale and under reciprocals, properties that are very appropriate when the observations are ratios of positive magnitudes. Additionally, suppose that the maximum likelihood estimator of the population mean is the sample mean (Gauss's principle). Surprisingly, only one statistical model satisfies these three properties and this is a special case of the generalized inverse gaussian family of distributions known as Harmonic Law.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, an extension to allow the presence of non-informative left- or right-censored observations in log-symmetric regression models is addressed. Under such models, the log-lifetime distribution belongs to the symmetric class and its location and scale parameters are described by semi-parametric functions of explanatory variables, whose nonparametric components are approximated using natural cubic splines or P-splines. An iterative process of parameter estimation by the maximum penalized likelihood method is presented. The large sample properties of the maximum penalized likelihood estimators are studied analytically and by simulation experiments. Diagnostic methods such as deviance-type residuals and local influence measures are derived. The package ssym, which includes an implementation in the computational environment R of the methodology addressed in this paper, is also discussed. The proposed methodology is illustrated by the analysis of a real data set.},
